 The Cr azy Ones Octob er 14, 1998 Heres to the crazy ones. The mis˝ts. The reb els. The troublemak ers. The round p egs in the square holes. The ones who see things di˙eren tly . Theyre not fond of rules. And they ha v e no resp ect for the status quo. Y ou can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. Ab out the only thing y ou cant do is ignore them. Because they c hange things. They in v en t. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the h uman race forw ard. Ma yb e they ha v e to b e crazy . Ho w else can y ou stare at an empt y can v as and see a w ork of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song thats nev er b een written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a lab oratory on wheels? W e mak e to ols for these kinds of p eople. While some see them as the crazy ones, w e see genius. Because the p eople who are crazy enough to think they can c hange the w orld, are the ones who do.
